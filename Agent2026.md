# International Workshop on Agent Engineering (Agent 2026)

***Co-located with [48th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2026), April 12-18 2026 in Rio de Janeiro***

### Theme & Goals

Foundation model-based AI agents have renewed interest in agent-based systems. Unlike traditional AI systems, agents are distinguished by their goal-oriented autonomy, their ability to perceive and react to complex environment, and their capacity for robust reasoning, planning, and decision-making at runtime. Many types of agents are emerging, such as API agents and GUI agents. 

Building such agents require careful system-level engineering to ensure critical qualities like reliability and safety. A key design challenge is the growing capability of foundation models such as large language models (LLMs). Developers must decide whether to rely on the LLM or external tools/systems for the same functionality. These decisions can be made at design time, development time, or even at runtime, depending on the problem and context. Highly autonomous agents also require continuous monitoring, observability, intervention, and oversight after deployment, an emerging discipline referred to as AgentOps. Designing this post-deployment environment is also highly complex, with many interdependent design choices. 


This workshop will serve as a forum for exploring cutting-edge engineering methods, techniques, and tools for engineering AI agents. It aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from both software engineering and AI to build a community focused on tackling the unique engineering challenges in developing AI agents. Participants will have the opportunity to share insights, innovations, and real-world experiences in the design, development, and operation of AI agents. 


### Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

 - Requirements engineering for agents, agentic systems, and multi-agent systems 
 - Architecture design for agents, agentic systems, and multi-agent systems
 - Verification, validation, and testing of agents, agentic systems, and multi-agent systems 
 - AgentOps - DevOps for agents, agentic systems, and multi-agent systems 
 - Development processes and lifecycle management for agents, agentic systems, and multi-agent systems
 - Evaluation methodologies, tools, and benchmarks for agents, agentic systems, and multi-agent systems 
 - Responsible AI and AI safety of agents, agentic systems, and multi-agent systems 
 - Human-agent interaction, collaboration, and oversight
 - Real-world case studies and practical experiences in different domains 




**Two types of contributions will be considered:**

- A research or experience full paper with 8 pages max. Papers describing the challenges, starting results, vision papers, or the experience papers from or in cooperation with the practitioners are encouraged.
- A short research or experience paper with 4 pages max. The same topics as for long papers.

### Submission Guidelines

1. All submissions must be in **English** and in **PDF format**, and must **not exceed the specified page limits**. Extra pages are not permitted under any circumstances.

2. A **Single-Anonymous Review** process will be used (i.e., reviewers will see author names, but not vice versa).

3. Submission policies and formatting requirements follow those of the [ICSE 2025 Research Track Submission Process](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2025/icse-2025-research-track#submission-process).

4. Submissions must conform to the official [ACM Primary Article Template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) at the time of submission. LaTeX users must use the `sigconf` option and include the `review` option to enable line numbers for reviewer reference.

   Use the following LaTeX declaration at the beginning of your document:

   \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}
