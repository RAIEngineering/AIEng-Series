# International Workshop on Agentic Engineering (AGENT'26)

***Co-located with [48th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2026), April 12-18 2026 in Rio de Janeiro***

### Theme & Goals

Agentic engineering is an emerging discipline focused on the design, development, and operation of systems that exhibit goal-directed autonomy, reasoning, and continuous evolution. Foundation models (FMs), such as large language models (LLM), have been accelerating progress in this area across academia and industry. 

Agentic systems often involve multiple interacting agents, humans, and tools, requiring rigorous system-level engineering to ensure critical qualities like robustness, safety, and observability. A key design challenge in agentic engineering is the growing capability of FMs/LLMs. Developers must decide whether to rely on the FM/LLM or external tools/systems for the same functionality. These decisions can be made at various stages depending on the problem and context: during design time, development time, or event at runtime from a software engineering perspective, and at pre-training time, post-training time, test/inference time, and post-inference time from an AI perspective. Highly autonomous agentic systems also require continuous monitoring, evaluation, observability, intervention, and oversight after deployment, an emerging discipline referred to as AgentOps. Designing this post-deployment environment is also highly complex, with many interdependent design choices. 

**This workshop will provide a forum for exploring cutting-edge engineering methods, techniques, and tools for agentic systems in general and agentic systems for software engineering in particular.** It will bring together researchers and practitioners to share insights, innovations, and real-world experiences in the design, development, and operation of agentic systems. 


### Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

 - Requirements engineering for agentic systems
 - Architectural design for agentic systems
 - Verification, validation, and testing of agentic systems
 - AgentOps - DevOps for agentic systems
 - Development processes and lifecycle management for agentic systems
 - Evaluation methodologies, tools, and benchmarks for agentic systems 
 - Responsible AI and AI safety of agentic systems 
 - Agentic systems for software engineering, including requirements, design, coding, testing, deployment, and operations
 - Human-agent interaction, collaboration, and oversight
 - Risk and impact assessment (e.g. economic/social impact)
 - Real-world case studies and practical experiences in different domains



**Two types of contributions will be considered:**

- A research or experience full paper with 8 pages max. Papers describing the challenges, starting results, vision papers, or the experience papers from or in cooperation with the practitioners are encouraged.
- A short research or experience paper with 4 pages max. The same topics as for long papers.

### Submission Guidelines

1. All submissions must be in **English** and in **PDF format**, and must **not exceed the specified page limits**. Extra pages are not permitted under any circumstances.

2. A **Single-Anonymous Review** process will be used (i.e., reviewers will see author names, but not vice versa).

3. Submission policies and formatting requirements follow those of the [ICSE 2025 Research Track Submission Process](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2025/icse-2025-research-track#submission-process).

4. Submissions must conform to the official [ACM Primary Article Template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) at the time of submission. LaTeX users must use the `sigconf` option and include the `review` option to enable line numbers for reviewer reference.

   Use the following LaTeX declaration at the beginning of your document:

   \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}
